## Contribution
### Anthony Yang
* Done: Made important decisions on how to implement the node. Started writing API for the node. 

* TODO:
For the upcoming week, I will continue working on the node. At this point, I am stuck on implementing the node in a single thread point of view. (We have to decide how to hide data within the noise.)

### Scott Lorentzen
* Done: 
Implemented client generated noise. Worked on testing different encryption schemes using JavaScript and Python.
* TODO:
For the next week, I will continue working on encryption. Specifically I will implement the hybrid layered encryption using a mixture of AES and RSA encryption.

### Ethan Chiang
* Done:
Worked on overall design of the system. More research on onion routing. Design doc of the communication protocol.
* TODO:
Learn more about Flask or maybe plan B. Look up existing onion routing code for python or JS (plan B). Start implementaion.

### Anthony Yang
* Done:
This week, I did research on onion routing protocols and brainstormed what I need to implement server nodes. 
* TODO:
For the upcoming week, I would start implementing the node structure. So far I am not stuck on any particular issue.
